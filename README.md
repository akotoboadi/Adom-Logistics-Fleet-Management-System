## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


ðŸšš Vehicle Tracking & Maintenance System
DCIT308: Data Structures and Algorithms II â€” Group Project Report
University of Ghana
July 2025

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
Adom Logistics is a regional freight transport company operating a fleet of trucks and delivery vans. The companyâ€™s manual record-keeping process has led to delayed servicing, route mix-ups, and inaccurate delivery logs.

This project implements a console-based Vehicle Tracking & Maintenance System, simulating dispatcher decisions, and utilizing key data structures and algorithms.

ðŸŽ¯ Functional Modules Implemented
âœ… Vehicle Database

Add, remove, and search vehicles by registration number.

Each vehicle stores:

Registration number

Type

Mileage

Fuel usage

Assigned driver

Maintenance history

Uses a TreeMap<String, Vehicle> for storage (efficient searching).

Supports binary search and custom sorting by mileage/type.

âœ… Driver Assignment & Activity Logs

Priority queue of available drivers, sorted by experience.

Stack of assigned drivers with activity tracking.

Logs include:

Assigned routes

Delays

Infractions

Supports saving and loading drivers to/from drivers.txt.

âœ… Delivery Tracking

Queue-based delivery tracking.

Each delivery stores:

Package ID

Origin & Destination

Assigned Vehicle & Driver

ETA & Status (Pending/In-Transit/Delivered)

Supports rerouting and updating based on package status.

Deliveries persist in deliveries.txt.

ðŸš§ Maintenance Scheduler (to be implemented by group member)

Prioritizes vehicles needing maintenance based on mileage and last service.

Records parts replaced and costs.

Uses a min-heap / priority queue.

Persists records in maintenance.txt.

ðŸš§ Fuel Efficiency Reports (to be implemented by group member)

Calculates average fuel usage and flags outliers.

Implements filtering and custom sorting of vehicles by fuel performance.

ðŸ§ª Data Structures & Algorithms
Feature	Data Structure/Algorithm
Vehicle DB	TreeMap (log n search)
Driver Assignment	PriorityQueue, Stack
Delivery Tracking	Queue, LinkedList
Maintenance Scheduler	PriorityQueue/Min-Heap
Sorting	Insertion/Merge/Quick
Searching	Binary Search
File Storage	Plain text files 

ðŸ“„ Report Summary
This system demonstrates application of data structures and algorithms in a real-world logistics context.

Time complexity of vehicle search: O(log n)

Space complexity proportional to number of vehicles, drivers, and deliveries.

Designed to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure timely maintenance.
